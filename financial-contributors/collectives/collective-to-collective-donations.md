# Collective to Collective donations

If you have a Collective with funds in its balance, you may use that as a payment method when contributing to another Collective within the same [Fiscal Host](../../fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts.md). There are no fees for this method of donating.

To donate using your Collective balance, simply make a contribution and select it as your payment method during checkout.

We are working on the functionality to enable Collectives to give directly to Collective in a different host. As a workaround for now, use the following process:

* Contact the Fiscal Host backing the receiving Collective and ask them to

  submit an expense to the giving Collective for your donation;

* The giving Collective will approve the expense and pay out the receiving Fiscal Host;
* The receiving Fiscal Host will then donate the money to the receiving Collective.
