Then, select the category that best describe your Collective.

If you are creating a Collective for communities of any kind or climate initiatives, you will be immediately directed to a Collective creation form, where you will be asked for your **Collective name**, **URL slug** of choice, and a **brief description** of your Collective's activities.

But if you are creating a Collective for an **open source project**, you will have to go through a verification process to join Open Source Collective fiscal host before filling that form.

### Open Source Collective verification

We offer two verification methods: **verification using GitHub stars** and **manual verification**.

Select the GitHub repository you would like to use in your application. If you select an organization repository, you will be given the option to either create a Collective for the repository, or a Collective for the organization itself.

#### Manual verification request

If you project don't meet that criteria, click on **Request manual verification**â€”your request will be reviewed using an [alternative verification criteria](https://www.oscollective.org/#criteria).
