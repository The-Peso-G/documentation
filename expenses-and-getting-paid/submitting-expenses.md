# Submitting Expenses

## To Submit an Expense

Go to the Collective you're submitting the expense to and click "Submit Expense".

![The location of the Submit Expense button on the Collective page: on the right side of the page, close to the Contact button.](../.gitbook/assets/expenses-and-getting-paid_submitting-expenses_collective-page_2020-05-11.png)

On the **Submit expense** page, you can submit two types of expenses—**reimbursements** and **invoices**—, check the **Collective balance**, review their **expense policies** and get the answers to a few of the most frequently asked questions on expenses.

### Reimbursement

A **reimbursement** allows you to be reimbursed for a purchase you already made. To open the submission form, click on **Reimbursement** and add a title to your expense.

#### Adding receipts

Add tags and upload one or multiple receipts by dragging and dropping files or opening the file selector. Describe each item and add the date of purchase and amount spent.

A **valid receipt** contains:

1. Name of vendor \(person or company you paid\)  
2. Transaction date \(when you paid\)  
3. Detailed description of goods or services purchased \(what you bought\)  
4. Amount paid  
5. Form of payment \(cash, check, or last four digits of credit card\)

### Invoice

{% hint style="info" %}
**Private information provided on invoices is not viewable publicly**. The expense amount will be listed on the Collective's public page, but the attached files \(receipts, invoices\) themselves are only visible to the host and core contributors.
{% endhint %}

An **invoice** allows you to be paid for your work, or to pay a vendor directly. To open the submission form, click on **Invoice** and add a title to your expense.

If you have an invoice ready, you can upload it as an attachment to the expense. However, you are still required to set invoice details such as description, date and amount. You can also create an invoice using the submission form by adding every item, date and amount.

### Payment details

You can specify who will be paid for this expense \(an individual or an organization\) and which payment method you wish to use. Additionally, the invoice form will ask for your country, physical address, and give you the option to add more info.

The availability of certain options depend on which plan the organization adopts, and may include **PayPal**, **wire transfers**, or a **custom method**.

#### PayPal

To use **PayPal**, you can either select one of the saved PayPal accounts or add a new one by adding the email address registered in said account.

#### Wire transfers

You can either selected a saved bank account or add a new one. To add a new bank account

1. Select the currency in which you would like to receive your payment.
2. Fill all fields with the requested info, making sure to not use any acronyms. **All fields are mandatory**, and may vary depending on the selected currency.

#### Custom payment method

Add any relevant info necessary to complete the transaction.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to be paid, submitted expenses must be approved by the Collective's core contributors \(admins\), who ensure valid use of the Collective's funds.
{% endhint %}

### Expense summary

The Expense summary provides you an overview of the expense to be submitted — attached files, items of an expense, payment preferences —, allowing you to review all info about your expense and quickly edit it if needed by clicking on **Edit expense**. You can also add a private note to Collective admins. Once your expense is ready to be submitted, click on **Submit expense**.
